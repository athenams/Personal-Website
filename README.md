* Progress! My sister told me about flex-box, which I've been trying to incorporate into some parts of my site. Styling itself is to a minimum so far - I'm trying mostly to get the structure of the thing solid.
- [ ]  What are conventions for naming classes and ids? Right now I have an iffy assortment of each, which I've named along the lines of "header" > "header-title" > "header-title-item" etc... but I'm worried these will get confusing as I go on.
